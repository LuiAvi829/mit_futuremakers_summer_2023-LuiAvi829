## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
This module served as a great review of NumPy. I haven't used NumPy in so long that I had forgotten some things.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
Questions 4 and 5 turned out to be the most challenging because I didn't remember them well. However, I conducted some research, understood the concepts, and managed to successfully answer the questions.

As additional resources I used a NumPy users guide (link: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html) and chatGPT.
