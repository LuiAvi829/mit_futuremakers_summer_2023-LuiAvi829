# Overfitting and Underfitting

## Topics covered in today's module
* Overfitting
* Underfitting
* Data preparation
* Reducing network capacity

## Main takeaways from doing today's assignment
Overfitting: when a machine learning model performs well on the training data but poorly on new or test data. It indicates that the model has learned noise and irrelevant patterns from the training data, resulting in reduced generalization to new examples.

Underfitting: when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the patterns in the data. It performs poorly on both the training data and unseen data because it does not learn the most important relationships and characteristics of the problem.

Data Preparation: process of cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data to make it suitable for training machine learning models.  Data cleaning and splitting the data into training and test sets are examples of data preparation.

Reducing Network Capacity: changing the architecture of a neural network to a more simple way, by decreasing the number of layers or the number of neurons per layer. The result is preventing overfitting, improving training speed, and enhancing generalization performance.

Tokenization:  process of breaking down a text or a sequence of characters into smaller units, then given them an integer that will work as the index in a dictionary.

## Challenging, interesting, or exciting aspects of today's assignment
What I found the most interesting was the learning process of data preparation and the different ways to prepare the data for training. The most challenging part was  comprehending tokenization,, when I understood it was really exciting.
